Even at a young age I was captivated by what makes the world work. I would spend my time dismantling almost everything I could get my hands on to see how it works, computers and other electronics more so than most. The older I became, the more I learned about the hardware available in this age of information that we live in. However, with every piece of knowledge I gained about the physical makeup of things came a thirst for what makes them tick on the inside.

When I was about twelve, I tried to teach myself C++, which did not go to well. I saw what looked to be a very complex new language and got scared. This was when I decided to just focus on what I could touch, what I knew, and what I was comfortable with. I finished my high school career with the intent of pursuing a career in being a mechanic. Throughout the remainder of my schooling, and the jobs I acquired since, I gained a new outlook on the world. I learned to not see challenges as scary and something to be avoided, rather as something to be overcome. With this new outlook and the knowledge that despite giving up on coding, my interest and desire to learn it has only grown stronger, I made the choice to try learning it on my own once more. 

As with before, I hit a brick wall. This time was a bit different though, instead of getting downhearted and giving up, I made the choice to look at it differently. It occurred to me that I might not be able to learn it completely on my own, pushing me to start looking at college. After almost a year of looking into schools, I learned about coding bootcamps, and started researching those. It wasn't long until I came across Flatiron, where the more I researched it, the more I thought: "this is the right path for me." 

After working on the Bootcamp Prep course offered here and having worked on the actual course work for a couple days, it has become apparent that this is what I was meant to do. I look forward to the next chapter of my life and to all the knowledge that it will bring.

To anyone reading this, thank you for your time and I look forward to potentially working with you in the future.

Good luck and happy learning
