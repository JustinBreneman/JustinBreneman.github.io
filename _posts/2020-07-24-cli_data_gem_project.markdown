This was my first project, and to be honest, I found it quite daunting at the start. My first hurdle came before I had even started coding: What to do? I knew that I wanted to do something that could actually be useful, yet I had a dificult time figuring out what to do. With the overwhelming amount of information available on the web, I was virtually drowning in choices. The day after I started thinking about what to do, I was playing Warframe with a friend of mine and it dawned on me. Why not make something to search relics without dealing with the [website](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki)? 

In order to get to the relic page, you need to either go through two other pages, or know the full URL. On top of that, this is a fandom.com page, so it has ads. Since this can get annoying after a while, this CLI app does the work for you. It goes to the relic page and grabs all the relics. The user can then choose from three different lists, or type in the name of a relic. This way, it can be utilized quicker than the site while remaining up to date.
